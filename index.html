			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p><b>A GUY I KNOW - CEBU, INC.</b> was established in 2015. Back then, we were a group of freelancers working together to deliver graphics, animations, and eLearning outputs to Australia-based clients.

These include EnableNow (which includes WebAssist), Articulate 360, Camtasia, Adobe Captivate, Ancile Prodpak, Multiple LMS (Learning Management systems), and the full Adobe Design Suite. <p><b>WHITEBELT INC.</b> is an all in one platform used by hundreds of martial arts schools in Australia.
